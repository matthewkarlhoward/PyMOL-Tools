# pymol

PyMOL is an incredible powerful program for the visualization of biochemical structures. Throughout the years, I have picked up many tips and tricks that I hope may be of use to others. 

For reproducibility purposes, I tend to save my work in the form of .pml files. These files can be opened and run by double-clicking, right-clicking and then selecting open in PyMOL, or by going to file/open... and then selecting your file. 

This is absolutely not designed to be an exhaustive manual for PyMOL, simply some of my most-used scripts and tools. I suggest checking out the PyMOLWiki if you question is not answered here.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions please raise an "issue" on this repo.
