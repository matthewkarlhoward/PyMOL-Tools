# PyMOL Tools

<a href="https://pymol.org/2/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">PyMOL</a> is an incredible powerful program for the visualization of biochemical structures. Throughout the years, I have picked up many tips and tricks that I hope may be of use to others as they navigate this software. While I actively use srcipts in this repository, I do not always upload the "final" versions of my scripts here. If you have questions about anything, please do not hesitate to post an issue or shoot me a message. 

For reproducibility purposes, I tend to save my work in the form of .pml files. These files can be opened and run by double-clicking, right-clicking and then selecting open in PyMOL, or by going to file/open... and then selecting your file. As with Python the "#" indicates a comment in the script. I encourage you to open any script in this repository in a text editor to read any comments and options that are enclosed in each--ie do not blindly use these scripts without reading them.

Finally, this is absolutely not designed to be an exhaustive manual for PyMOL, simply some of my most-used scripts and tools. I suggest checking out the <a href="https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">PyMOLWiki</a> if you question is not answered here.
